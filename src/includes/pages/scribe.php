      <p>Scribe Software, a market leader in data integration software, embarked on a project to re-imagine is legacy data integration platform. In a market dominated by highly technical products, Scribe was driven by a desire to offer the most approachable integration solution in the market. </p>
      <p>Where users were typically operating in code snippets and command lines, Scribe set out to build an experience built on, “clicks, not code.”  With hundreds of customers using a legacy product, this was a massive undertaking with many challenges. Scribe worked with Proximity Lab to be involved throughout the process - from business objective definition through design implementation.</p>

      <h2>Focused Research and  User Journies</h2>
      <p>Using a combination of market research tools and processes, our team set out to understand the existing Scribe solution - why it existed and what were most useful parts? To answer this, we worked with the internal product teams to understand the mechanics of the product and learn about specific pain points directly from customer interviews.</p>
      <p>The creation of key persona types, idealized journey maps, and key workflows helped focus on the actionable business and UI needs that required support and to help shape the product roadmap.</p>

          <h2>Platform Modernization</h2>
          <p class=" pb-5 mb-5">Prior to designing the new experience, we worked with the Scribe team to identify both the weaknesses of the existing platform and the requirements of the new platform. By shedding the legacy technology and moving to a modern SaaS platform, all of the new features and capabilities required for the key personas could be developed. This new architecture would also allow for new features to be added as needed.</p>

      <h2>Visual Coding Support</h2>
      <p>One unique aspect of the new data integration platform was the support for visual coding. This was a critical feature to support the goal of enabling a cultural shift in how the product was used and who would be able to use it. Ultimately the new Scribe platform included a Scratch-based coding platform that helped fulfill the vision of, “clicks, not code,” enabling non-technical users to perform data integration.</p>

      <h2>Design Excellence</h2>
      <p>While all of the preceding work was critical in determining the usability of the product, a large part of the challenge was creating a user interface design that would make the vision of simple data integration a reality without compromising the powerful capabilities of the product. The resulting interface was recognized by the leading market research firms as, “the best-in-class,” for data integration.</p>
