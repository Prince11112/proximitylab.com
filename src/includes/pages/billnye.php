      <p>Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” is one of the most recognizable faces in science education. Using his status as a science superstar, his organization worked with the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center to develop a concept designed to educate kids and families on the issues related to climate change. Proximity Lab was engaged to lead the research and design of a streamlined experience that would ultimately become a permanent exhibit focused on climate science, global climate change, and green technology and conservation solutions to human impact on the global environment. The objective: to do all of this AND make it fun and engaging for school-aged children.</p>
      <p>The team researched and explored many ideas that would help bring the concept to life. We visited other interactive exhibits to learn as much as possible about what worked and what didn’t. We spoke with kids about what they loved most about science, technology, and museums. Working collaboratively with Bill and his team, the vision for the exhibits started to take shape.</p>

      <h1 class="heading-primary">Digital content</h1>
      <p>We designed and developed a web-based experience that featured climate related content and incorporated that into interactive learning-based games. Kids created accounts, selected avatars, and discovered games that allowed them collect points as they moved through each of the climate-based activities focused on air, water, and land in the Earth's environment, the impacts on them by human activity, and challenges its visitors to seek solutions.</p>

      <p class="text-center">To help kids understand how their daily choices affect and influence climate change, we designed and developed several exhibits, including, "Bike with Bill," which featured a stationary bike hooked up to sensors that allowed kids to virtually pedal and the streets of San Francisco while understanding their carbon footprint. The gallery features an interactive video wall that is dynamically populated with avatars of all of the visitors in the museum. Kids simply scan their badge and their avatar appears and lights up. The system encourages kids to go through all of the exhibit stations to earn points that can be used for, "power ups."</p>

      <h1 class="heading-primary">Beyond the museum</h1>
      <p>A key finding was that there was an opportunity to improve the overall experience by extending the learning beyond the gallery walls. To do this, our team created a native mobile game called, “Lab Dash,” that was tied into the experience. As kids play the game, they collect points that are also part of the same program so that when they returned to the museum, they could cash them in for more, “power ups,” and unlock new levels in the game -- helping to achieve long-term engagement.</p>

      <p class="text-center">All of our concepts were tested and validated with kids in the gallery space. We even tested the incentive models - cashing in points for power ups, versus customizing your avatar, unlocking levels. We are proud of this project and how well it was received. The year the exhibit opened it received a "Best of Show," award from MITX for Excellence in Interactive Innovation.  It was also named as a, "Family Favorite," by BayAreaParent in 2016.</p>
