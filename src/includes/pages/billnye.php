      <p>Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” is one of the most recognizable faces in science education. Using his status as a science superstar, his organization worked with the Chabot Space & Science Center to develop a concept designed to educate kids and families on the issues related to climate change. Proximity Lab was engaged to lead the research and design of a streamlined experience that would ultimately become a permanent exhibit focused on climate science, global climate change, and green technology and conservation solutions to human impact on the global environment. The objective: to do all of this AND make it fun and engaging for school-aged children.</p>
      <p>The team researched and explored many ideas that would help bring the concept to life. We visited other interactive exhibits to learn as much as possible about what worked and what didn’t. We spoke with kids about what they loved most about science, technology, and museums. Working collaboratively with Bill and his team, the vision for the exhibits started to take shape.</p>

      <h2>Focused Research and  User Journeys</h2>
      <p>Using a combination of market research tools and processes, our team set out to understand the existing Scribe solution - why it existed and what were most useful parts? To answer this, we worked with the internal product teams to understand the mechanics of the product and learn about specific pain points directly from customer interviews.</p>
      <p>The creation of key persona types, idealized journey maps, and key workflows helped focus on the actionable business and UI needs that required support and to help shape the product roadmap.</p>

          <h2>Platform Modernization</h2>
          <p class=" pb-5 mb-5">Prior to designing the new experience, we worked with the Scribe team to identify both the weaknesses of the existing platform and the requirements of the new platform. By shedding the legacy technology and moving to a modern SaaS platform, all of the new features and capabilities required for the key personas could be developed. This new architecture would also allow for new features to be added as needed.</p>

      <h2>Visual Coding Support</h2>
      <p>One unique aspect of the new data integration platform was the support for visual coding. This was a critical feature to support the goal of enabling a cultural shift in how the product was used and who would be able to use it. Ultimately the new Scribe platform included a Scratch-based coding platform that helped fulfill the vision of, “clicks, not code,” enabling non-technical users to perform data integration.</p>

      <h2>Design Excellence</h2>
      <p>While all of the preceding work was critical in determining the usability of the product, a large part of the challenge was creating a user interface design that would make the vision of simple data integration a reality without compromising the powerful capabilities of the product. The resulting interface was recognized by the leading market research firms as, “the best-in-class,” for data integration.</p>
