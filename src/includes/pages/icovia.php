      <p>Icovia’s space planning app started as a simple project to help create a home theater configuration tool - basically allowing users to position their products on an overhead view of a room. At the time, the team had a vision that this simple tool had much larger potential. The resulting app became the most powerful web-based 2D and 3D space planning app on market - in use by hundreds of retailers. But that’s exactly what happened.</p>
      <p>The work we completed in order to build and launch the SchduleMe app consisted of competitive research, persona interviews, and concept testing</p>

        <p><strong>Custom space creation</strong> <br />Consumers could use the app to create accurate floor plans of their spaces.</p>
        <p><strong>Realtime 3D rendering</strong> <br />This allowed site visitors to pick specific products from their retailers catalog, choose the desired fabric, and drag the icon to the map of their space.</p>
        <p><strong>Powerful marketing capabilities</strong> <br />Although using the app for consumers was easy and free, the retailers were able to collect valuable marketing information by requiring users to register if they wanted to print, share, or save their room designs.</p>

Ultimately Icovia was acquired for its market leading technology and is still in use at hundreds of leading U.S. retailers.</p>
