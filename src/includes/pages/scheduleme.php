      <p>The team of entrepreneurs at ScheduleMe had an innovative idea for taking the frustration and complexity out of scheduling meetings. Because traditional calendar systems do not make it easy to identify days and times that work for multiple people to schedule meetings, ScheduleMe had a vision for a system that allowed for individual users to integrate their calendars with ScheduleMe, grant permission to their friends and colleagues to access their calendars, and see an interactive list of available times and dates. When they looked for a creative design partner to help bring their vision to life they chose the Proximity Lab team.</p>
      <p>The work we completed in order to build and launch the SchduleMe app consisted of competitive research, persona interviews, and concept testing</p>
