      <p>As professional designers and photographers, the founders of Mosaic were frustrated by the limitation of tools to help manage their photo libraries on their mobile devices. While the Adobe Lightroom app was a mainstay of their work, it lacked mobile management features. The Mosaic team reached out to Proximity Lab to help research and design a native companion mobile app for Lightroom to simplify digital asset management for creative professionals. Our work for this project included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Researchâ€¨</h4>
          We evaluated existing apps in the market and interviewed prospective users
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Branding</h4>
          We created a logo and other visual identity materials
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>UX/UI Design</h4>
          Our team designed a fully native iOS experience for both phones and tablets
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The app successfully became a companion app to Adobe Lightroom - providing professional photographers with anytime, anywhere access to their digital asset libraries on their mobile devices. Mosaic sold to OnOne Software in October 2014.</p>
