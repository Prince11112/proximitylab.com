      <p>Eagle Genomics is an award-winning provider of software analysis tools to assist with genomics research. Its products are used by some of the largest life science companies in the world. As Eagle looked to expand its product portfolio, it developed a concept for an app that would allow researchers to perform multi-dimensional analyses on massive sets of biological data to allow for greater efficiency in the research process. Because this new app would incorporate new interface concepts and need to accommodate new user types, the Eagle team looked for a design partner who could help and selected our team.</p>

        <p>"Proximity Lab was an excellent UX/UI product strategy and design partner. They helped us accelerate our understanding of user journeys and user profiles, and ultimately created stunning visual designs that enabled us to demonstrate the power of our product to current and new customers. Although the Proximity Lab is US based and we are UK based, the project ran smoothly with effective communications that kept all the team members on both sides constantly in the loop, as if it were one single team."
