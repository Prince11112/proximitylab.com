While there were other products on the market that helped dog owners monitor certain aspects of their dog’s life (location and activity), none had the range of features and capabilities that had been envisioned for the Wagz connected collar -- including an integrated HD camera to allow users to see what their dogs are seeing.</p>

        <p>"The Wagz team was blown away by the work by Proximity Lab. While we were originally looking for a UX/UI partner to help improve an app we had in mind to accompany our collar, we ended up with a comprehensive design partner. We couldn’t be happier with the result of our collaboration on this ambitious project."
