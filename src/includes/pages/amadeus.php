      <p>Amadeus Hospitality, formerly Newmarket International, is the world’s leading provider of hospitality management software. It’s range of software applications allow hotel staff to manage virtually every aspect of the hotel experience. When Amadeus was looking to modernize several applications related to event planning and management, it turned to Proximity Lab.</p>
      <p>Before redesigning the user experience, we researched the market to analyze existing products, understand target users, and evaluate idealized feature sets. That work was critical in driving the focus and direction of the project, including:</p>
      <div class="ww-paragraph">
        <p>Formalizing the target personae who would most benefit from the new experience</p>
        <p>Prioritizing feature sets & shaping the product roadmap</p>
        <p>Identifying areas for integration with other Amadeus Hospitality applications</p>

      <h2>Re-crafting an integrated experience</h2>
        <p>As our team moved into the UX/UI design phase with clear vision for how Amadeus wanted to engagement more deeply with event planners, we went to work designing an intuitive and powerful new experience -- one that needed to integrate existing apps with new functionality from software that had been acquired. In order to help improve their experience and possibly change their behavior, the new end-to-end experience for the event planning & management apps would need to support modern features and use cases.</p>
